The original data is part of a research project I conducted during my undergraduate in Media Studies in which I used content analysis to find out the following - 'To what extent does Reddit as a social media platform, specifically the subreddit “/r/changemyview”, allow for a Habermas-Style Public Sphere?’

We chose a total of 10 popular posts in the week to analyze - 5 were topical issues (morality, politics etc) while the remaining 5 were 'slice of life' posts based on personal grievances.

Three coding sheets were prepared to identify key areas – one on the vocabulary used to highlight personal experiences in their arguments, one on the ways users reference sources in their arguments, and one on visual cues of hierarchy within the forum layout of the subreddit. The data was then presented as a 10-minute interview where the data was briefly analyzed, and early conclusions were made based on observations and trends. A research paper was later made using the data collected but with more in-depth analysis using Habermas’ Theory of the Public Sphere.

Now that I am learning skills in Data Analytics, including how to use Tableau, I thought I would try to recreate the data used in this research.
